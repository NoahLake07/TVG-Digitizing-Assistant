# Tape Digitizing Assistant
TVG Digitizing Assistant is a Java-based desktop application designed to assist with the process of digitizing media. The application provides a user-friendly interface for managing and tracking the conversion of various media types.

## Features
- **Project Management**: The application allows users to create and manage projects. Each project can contain multiple conversions, usually per client, and each conversion represents a single digitization task.
- **Conversion Management**: Within each digitizing project, users can create and manage conversions. Each conversion includes details such as the name, note, type, date of conversion, and time of conversion. 
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The application provides a clean and intuitive interface. The main window is divided into a sidebar and a main content area. The sidebar lists all conversions in the current project, and the main content area displays the details of the selected conversion.
- **Data Persistence**: The application supports saving the current state of a project to a file. This allows users to close the application and resume their work at a later time.
